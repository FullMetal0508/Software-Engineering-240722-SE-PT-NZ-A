Lion El'Jonson, also known as The Lion and The First, is the Primarch of the Dark Angels. He was scattered along with the other Primarchs to the far corners of the galaxy. He finally came to rest on the world Caliban, a beautiful but blighted world tainted by Chaos due to its proximity to the Eye of Terror. Lion El'Jonson was renowned for a level of strategic brilliance and martial prowess that was rivaled perhaps only by Horus, but was distrusted by his brother Primarchs for his secretive and taciturn nature. The Chaos emissary to Lorgar called him the Duelist. Having disappeared for ten millennia following the Destruction of Caliban after the Horus Heresy, The Lion has finally returned to the Imperium following the Arks of Omen Campaign.",
